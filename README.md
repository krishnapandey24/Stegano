## Introduction

üìù Steganography is the art of concealing information within a carrier medium, such as an image, audio, or video file, without attracting attention. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography is a common technique where the least significant bit of each pixel in an image is replaced with bits of the secret message.

Our steganography application provides a user-friendly interface for users to hide text messages inside images using the LSB technique. Additionally, users have the option to encrypt the text before hiding it for added security. The application also allows users to decode text from an encoded image to retrieve hidden messages.

## Features

üöÄ List the key features of your steganography application:

- Hide text messages inside images using LSB steganography.
- Encrypt text before embedding to enhance security.
- Decode hidden text from an encoded image.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Support for multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- Intuitive and responsive user interface built with Flutter Web.
- Backend implementation using Spring Boot for efficient processing.
- Database storage using PostgreSQL for reliability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

üõ†Ô∏è List the technologies and frameworks used in your project:

- Flutter Web: Frontend framework for building web applications.
- Spring Boot: Backend framework for Java applications.
- PostgreSQL: Open-source relational database management system.
